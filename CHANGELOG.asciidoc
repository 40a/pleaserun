= Pleaserun Changes and Releases

== 0.0.19 (May 6, 2016)

== 0.0.18 (May 6, 2016)
  * Support newer Facter api (Aaron Mildtenstein)

== 0.0.17 (May 4, 2016)
  * Added detection for Fedora 22 and 23, OS X 10.11, and Ubuntu 14.10, 15.04, 15.50, and 16.04. (#98, Aaron Mildenstein)

== 0.0.13  (April 30, 2015)
  * Now supports MRI 1.9.3 (Vincent Janelle)
  * cli: New flag --install-prefix. This lets you tell pleaserun what directory to write things.
  * cli: New flag --[no-]install-actions. If enabled, will run any required installation actions in order to signal the local system to load your newly created service.
  * upstart: now only generates the .conf file, not the init script,
    since it's not needed.
  * sysv: Add ulimit support
  * detection: Amazon Linux is now detected and, because it is based on RHEL6, defaults to Upstart 0.6.5 (Bob Miller, #68)
  * misc: The ohai gem is now optional. Ohai is incompatible with JRuby, so I don't want to require it by default. The ohai gem will still be used, if present, during platform detection.
  * cli: New flag --sysv-log-path. This lets you set the path for the sysv platform to log its output.

== 0.0.4 (March 5, 2014)
  * cli: Autodetect OSX and use launchd
